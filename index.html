Most students start with “I don’t have a story” — but we’ll dig deep together and find one that shows your character, growth, and uniqueness. And it’s important to note that there is so much beauty in simplicity. You don’t need to most adventurous or chaotic life in order to tell a beautiful story about who you are.</p>

                        <p>Not at all! In fact, starting early gives you a huge advantage. This isn’t about writing your essay now — it’s about living your story. As a 9th or 10th grader, you have time to explore interests, try new things, and reflect on what really matters to you. That self-awareness becomes the foundation for a powerful essay later on. We offer early-stage guidance to help you develop experiences now that will naturally lead to great stories when it’s time to apply.</p>
